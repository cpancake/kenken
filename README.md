# kenken solver

It solves [KenKen puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen). That's all it does. If it does anything else, you should let me know.

Puzzles are input via boards.js as a list of cages. The top left square is 1, the one to the right of it is 2, etc. So a cage in a 3x3 KenKen board that forms an L shape to the left would be 1,4,7,8.
